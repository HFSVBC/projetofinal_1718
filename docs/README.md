# CA FCUL Documentation
## Description {docsify-ignore}
The project's objective is to develop and create a platform to store, verify, and manage access data relative to the buildings and classrooms of the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon. This platform is accessible through a Web interface and made available in a *cloud* environment, and presents solutions for ease of integration with the already existing control protocols in FCUL of buildings and classroom access management.

This solution will assure the availability, confidentiality, and accuracy of the data. Should there be a hardware failure, the system will tolerate it with minimal performance reduction and without data loss; unavailability due to catastrophic failure will no surpass the 24 hour mark, with the only acceptable data loss being that which would have been introduced into the system within a 24 hour timeframe. Back-end development also guarantees that the platform is both scalable and modular, so that it can support and manage points of high usage outside of the average that are predicted to happen in some situations.

## Main functionalities: {docsify-ignore}
