# Criar Acessos
---

Accessed by the route `/criar-acessos`, it allows the security members and the administrator to create a temporary user access for someone that is not in the database. This requires the personal information of the visitor as well of the person responsible for their visit, their contact information, and other data relevant to the access such as the reason for the visit and the timeframe the temporary access will be valid for.
