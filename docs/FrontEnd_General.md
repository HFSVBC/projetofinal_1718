## Auth

For authenticate a user in our aplication we use ```Google Firebase```.

This will simulate the ```CAS``` authentication that we use in FCUL.

The users has to login with his ```Gmail``` Account.

## User Types

We will have diferent users that will use this aplication and we need to have a way to separate them. 

So we got 5 types of users:

- Student
- Professor
- â€‹Staff Member
- Security
- Admin

Each user has a certain pages that he can access.
